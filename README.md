## Description

This is a website to showcase things about me, my interests, and my best projects I've made at Epicodus.  It includes links to some of my projects repositories, and an about me section that goes over how I got to this point and started my journey in programming. I've also attached images of things that inspire me so you can get a better idea of me as a person.
