      <li>
        <strong><a href="https://github.com/FrankTimmons/animal-shelter">Animal Shelter Website</a></strong>
        <p>
          This was a fun website to mess around with the box model a little bit, and use cascading styles. We tried to include a few of our own favorite animals to spice it up a bit. <em>This project uses HTML and CSS</em>.

      <li>
        <strong><a href="https://github.com/FrankTimmons/vacation-site">Vacation Resort Website</a></strong>
        <p>
          This was a fun website to practice using bootstrap columns and other bootstrap stylings. This was a place I went to on a trip to Japan a couple years ago and it was nice to revisit it by making this website. <em>This project uses HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap</em>.

        <strong><a href="https://github.com/FrankTimmons/cupcake-shop">Cupcake Shop Website</a></strong>
        <p>
          This was a funny website that was made when we were first practicing box models.  We wanted to push everything to the extreme and find some funny new styling options.  It's definitely incomplete but it gives me a good chuckle when I look at it. <em>This project uses HTML and CSS</em>.
