    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong><a class="link" href="https://github.com/FrankTimmons/animal-shelter">Animal Shelter Website</a></strong>
        <p>
          This was a fun website to mess around with the box model a little bit, and use cascading styles. We tried to include a few of our own favorite animals to spice it up a bit. <em>This project uses HTML and CSS</em>.

      <li>
        <strong><a class="link" href="https://github.com/FrankTimmons/vacation-site">Vacation Resort Website</a></strong>
        <p>
          This was a fun website to practice using bootstrap columns and other bootstrap stylings. This was a place I went to on a trip to Japan a couple years ago and it was nice to revisit it by making this website. <em>This project uses HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap</em>.

        <strong><a class="link" href="https://github.com/FrankTimmons/cupcake-shop">Cupcake Shop Website</a></strong>
        <p>
          This was a funny website that was made when we were first practicing box models.  We wanted to push everything to the extreme and find some funny new styling options.  It's definitely incomplete but it gives me a good chuckle when I look at it. <em>This project uses HTML and CSS</em>.

    <h2 class="center-text">About Me!</h2>
    <p>
      My name is <span class="flashy">Frank Timmons</span>. I've lived in Portland, OR for my whole life. I graduated from Grant High School, and decided to start working right away. My first job after high school was in the mailroom at the Wieden+Kennedy ad agency, I had a temp position during the holidays because there were more packages around that time of year and they needed some extra help. After that I got a job at a 3D printing and scuplture foundry called Form 3D.  My main role there was being the head of the shipping department, but I also ended up learning a lot about the computer programs that go into 3D printing, and some more hands on artistic stuff. I worked there for 3 years but I was feeling like I needed a change due to lack of organization, and the fear of being around toxic chemicals all day long.

    <p>
      That is what has lead me here today to start my journey through Epicodus! I'm realy excited to continue through the course and learn more about the world of programming. My ultimate goal would be to become a game developer, but for now I'm just hoping to get any job that will strengthen my programming, problem solving skills, and teamwork so I can make games as a hobby.
